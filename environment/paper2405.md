ABSTRACT

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention
for their revolutionary capabilities. However, there is also growing
concern on their safety implications as the outputs generated by
LLMs may contain various kinds of harmful contents, making a
comprehensive safety evaluation1 for LLMs urgently needed be-
fore model deployment. Existing safety evaluation benchmarks still
suffer from the following limitations: 1) the lack of a unified risk
taxonomy makes it challenging to systematically categorize, evalu-
ate and be aware of different types of risks, 2) the weak riskiness
limits the capacity to sincerely reflect the safety of LLMs effectively,
and 3) the lack of automation in terms of test prompts generation,
selection, and output riskiness evaluation.

To address these critical challenges, we propose S-Eval, a new
comprehensive, multi-dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation
benchmark for LLMs. At the core of S-Eval is a novel LLM-based
automatic test prompt generation and selection framework, which
trains an expert testing LLM Mùë° to support various test prompt
generation tasks combined with a range of test selection strate-
gies to automatically construct a high-quality test suite (including
base risk prompts and attack prompts) for the safety evaluation.

The key to the automation of this process is a novel expert safety-
critique LLM Mùëê able to quantify the riskiness score of an LLM‚Äôs
response, and additionally produce risk tags and explanations for
better risk awareness. Besides, the generation process is also guided
by a carefully designed risk taxonomy with four different levels,
covering comprehensive and multi-dimensional safety risks of con-
cern. Based on the proposed risk taxonomy and the test prompt
generation/selection framework, we systematically construct a new
and large-scale safety evaluation benchmark for LLMs consisting
of 220,000 evaluation prompts, including 20,000 base risk prompts
(10,000 in Chinese and 10,000 in English) and 200,000 correspond-
ing attack prompts derived from 10 popular adversarial instruction
attacks against LLMs. Moreover, considering the rapid evolution
of LLMs and accompanied safety threats, S-Eval can be flexibly
configured and adapted to include new risks, attacks and models
for updating the benchmark. S-Eval is extensively evaluated on 20
popular and representative LLMs. The results confirm that S-Eval
can better reflect and inform the safety risks of LLMs compared
to existing benchmarks. We also explore the impacts of parameter
scales, language environments, and decoding parameters on the
evaluation, providing a systematic methodology for evaluating the
safety of LLMs and offering insights on the safety situation of main-
stream LLMs in the market. Our benchmark and experimental data
are both released at [3] to facilitate and benchmark future research
in this critical direction.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as
a prominent research focus across various domains due to their
revolutionary capabilities. With the expansion of training data
and model parameters, the emergent abilities of LLMs [56] are
increasingly obvious, thus promoting their applications in diverse
downstream tasks. More and more LLMs, such as ChatGPT [36],
Claude [4], Gemini [45], ErnieBot [20], LLaMA [48] and Qwen
[5] and so on, are widely adopted in finance [41], medicine [44],
education [23] and law [9] and many other domains.

However, there are also significant concerns regarding the safety
implications of LLMs with their rapid adoption in different ap-
plications, since LLMs are often trained on massive textual data,
which lack appropriate supervision and may contain harmful con-
tents, such as illegal advice [13], offensiveness, hate speech, insults
[15], bias and discrimination [39]. These rooted safety issues in the
training data make it inevitable for the resulting LLMs to generate
contents inconsistent with human values and pose potential risks
of misuse. Therefore, a comprehensive multidimensional safety
evaluation for LLMs is imperative before their deployment.

Currently, researchers have attempted to design some safety
evaluation benchmarks covering either specific safety concerns
[15, 16, 38] or multiple risk dimensions [14, 18, 28, 30, 42, 53, 54,
59, 65, 67]. However, existing benchmarks still suffer from sev-
eral significant limitations. First, the risk taxonomies of existing
safety benchmarks are loose without a unified risk taxonomy par-
adigm. Consequently, the coarse-grained evaluation results can
only reflect a (small) portion of the safety risks of LLMs, failing
to comprehensively evaluate fine-grained safety situation of LLMs
on the subdivided risk dimensions. Second, existing benchmarks
have weak riskiness which limits its capability to sincerely reflect
the safety of LLMs effectively (evidenced by our empirical results).
For instance, some benchmarks [16, 38, 65] are only evaluated with
multiple-choice questions (due to the lack of a test oracle), which is
inconsistent with the real-world user case and limits the risks that
may arise in responses, thus cannot reflect an LLM‚Äôs real safety
levels. Other benchmarks like [18, 28, 42] only consider some back-
ward and incomplete instruction attack methods, failing to picture
the safety of LLMs under more various adversarial attack scenarios.
Third, construction of existing benchmarks often lacks automation
in terms of test prompts generation, selection and output riskiness
evaluation requiring numerous human labor, which hinders its
effective adaptability to quickly evolving LLM and accompanied
safety threats.

In this work, we propose S-Eval, a new comprehensive, multi-
dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation benchmark to sys-
tematically address the above limitations. Firstly, we design a com-
prehensive and unified risk taxonomy with four hierarchical levels

Figure 1: Our four-level risk taxonomy. We only display the
first-level risk dimensions and second-level risk categories.

consisting of eight risk dimensions, 25 risk categories, 56 risk sub-
categories, and 52 risk sub-subcategories, as shown in Figure 1 (the
complete details can be found at [3]). The risk taxonomy aims to
cover all the necessary dimensions of the safety evaluation and
reflect the varying safety levels of the LLMs on the subdivided risk
dimensions. Secondly, to automatically construct a test suite for
safety evaluation, we propose a novel LLM-based automatic test
prompts generation and selection framework, as shown in Figure
2. Specifically, we train an expert testing LLM Mùë° that supports
various test prompts generation tasks with configurable risks of
interest and test generation methods, combined with a range of test
selection strategies for quality control to construct a high-quality
benchmarking safety test suite. Note that the above test genera-
tion and selection are empowered by a novel expert safety-critique
LLM Mùëê . This safety-critique model is trained by supervised fine-
tuning using a carefully crafted dataset. In addition to serve as a
test oracle by providing a risk score for an LLM‚Äôs response to a test
prompt, the model is also designed to output the risk tags, scores,
and explanations for better risk awareness to the decision makers.
So far, S-Eval has (and is still in active expansion) automatically
generated 220,000 high-quality test prompts for safety evaluation,
including 20,000 base risk prompts2 (10,000 in Chinese and 10,000
in English) and 200,000 corresponding attack prompts. Thirdly,
considering the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanied safety
threats, we design S-Eval to be flexibly configured and adapted to
include new risks, attacks and models for updating the benchmark.
We extensively evaluate S-Eval with 20 popular and mainstream
LLMs that cover both open-source and closed-source LLMs with
different organizations, model scales and languages. The results
confirm that S-Eval can better reflect and inform the safety risks
awareness of LLMs compared to existing safety benchmarks. We
also explore the impacts of parameter scales, language environ-
ments, and decoding parameters on the evaluation, resulting in a
systematic methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs.

In summary, we make the following contributions:

‚Ä¢ We design a new unified risk taxonomy, consisting of four
hierarchical levels, covering broad risk characterization and
being able to reflect the safety levels of LLMs on subdivided
risk dimensions. When new safety risks emerge, the risk

‚Ä¢ We propose a novel LLM-based automatic test generation
and selection framework to generate base risk prompts and
attack prompts. Considering the rapid evolution of safety
threats and LLMs, we design the framework to be flexibly

‚Ä¢ We propose to train an expert safety-critique LLM to not only

prompts generated by 10 advanced instruction attacks to
comprehensively evaluate the safety levels of LLMs in both
conventional and adversarial attack scenarios.

‚Ä¢ We extensively evaluate 20 popular LLMs. The results con-
firm that S-Eval can better reflect the safety level of LLMs
compared to existing safety benchmarks. We also explore the
impacts of parameter scales, language environments, and de-
coding parameters on the evaluation, providing a systematic
methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs.

2 PRELIMINARY
2.1 Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning models.
Currently, most LLMs are built based upon the Transformer archi-
tecture [52], and they are trained on massive textual corpora with a
large number of parameters to effectively understand and generate
natural language text. LLMs are widely used in various natural

A common method of interacting with LLMs is prompt engi-
neering [31, 58], in which users guide LLMs to generate desired
responses or complete specific tasks through well-designed prompt
text. Prompts are critical to the quality of the output of LLMs, and
small changes to the prompt result in large performance variations
[32, 40].

2.2 Safety Evaluation Problem

In safety evaluation task, given an LLM M, we need an evalu-
ation prompt set P = {ùëù1, ùëù2, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëùùëõ }, and an safety evaluation
model J (¬∑) ‚àà {0, 1} to judge whether a harmful response is trig-
gered. Let ùëüùëñ be the response of M to the prompt ùëùùëñ ‚àà P, which
is considered harmful when J (ùëùùëñ, ùëüùëñ ) = 0 and safe otherwise. In
this work, we aim to construct an evaluation prompt set P based
on the designed risk taxonomy C that can effectively reflect the
safety of LLMs on the subdivided risk dimensions. Specifically,
our evaluation prompt set consists of two parts: P = {Pùêµ, Pùê¥},
, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëùùêµ
where Pùêµ = {ùëùùêµ
, ùëùùêµ
ùëö } denotes the base risk prompt set and

Pùê¥ = {ùëùùê¥

vast diverse input space and adversarial scenarios respectively.

In this section, we first provide an overview of the proposed S-Eval
framework, and then present the detailed risk taxonomy and test
prompt generation/selection methods.

level, given a risk taxonomy (details later), in the training flow

prompts based on the risk definitions and generate corresponding

attack prompts using multiple instruction attacks. Then, we train
an expert test-generation LLM Mùë° with these prompts. In the gen-
eration flow (solid line), we first use Mùë° to automatically generate
a set of base risk prompts, and then remove similar and benign
prompts to select a high-quality base risk prompt set ùëÉ ùêµ. Subse-
quently, we apply Mùë° to generate corresponding attack prompts
for each prompt in ùëÉ ùêµ. Finally, we identify those meaningless at-
tack prompts and regenerate to obtain the attack prompt set ùëÉùê¥.
Next, we present details on the proposed risk taxonomy C, the test
prompt generation and selection methods and the evaluation model
J to judge whether a harmful response is triggered.

3.2 Risk Taxonomy

The motivation of S-Eval is to help researchers and developers
comprehensively evaluate the safety of LLMs so that they can be
intuitively informed of the concrete safety threats in a certain as-
pect. With this goal in mind, we first systematically analyze the
existing taxonomies [14, 30, 37, 53]. Then, we design a new unified
multidimensional fine-grained risk taxonomy by summarizing risks
that may arise during the use of LLMs and decoupling different
risks from each other by considering the intent and context of them,
which is intended to reflect the safety levels of LLMs on the sub-
divided risk dimensions. Our taxonomy also considers risks that
are not covered in other taxonomies, like the threats caused by
technological autonomy. Specifically, the risk taxonomy has a struc-
tured hierarchy with four levels, comprising 8 risk dimensions, 25
risk categories, 56 risk subcategories, and 52 risk sub-subcategories.
The first-level risk dimensions and second-level risk categories
are shown in Figure 1. The risk dimensions at the top level are as
follows (all details available at [3] ).

Crimes and Illegal Activities (CI). This dimension refers to
behaviors that violate laws and regulations, including criminal acts
as well as non-criminal violations of administrative laws and regu-
lations. This includes, but is not limited to, viewing pornographic
content, rape, drug production and trafficking, production of dan-
gerous weapons, theft, robbery, tax evasion, embezzlement, bribery,
and infringement of intellectual property rights.

Hate Speech (HS). It refers to the publication of insulting, sar-
castic, cursing, profane, threatening, or other disparaging speech or
written content directed at a specific individual or group of individ-
uals for various reasons. It may provoke aversion, fear, or hatred of
others, potentially culminating in direct or indirect harm, ostracism,
or oppression.

Physical and Mental Health (PM). This category of risk en-
compasses behaviors that could potentially jeopardize human phys-
ical and mental well-being, comprising two distinct subcategories:
(a) Physical Harm pertains to injuries or damage inflicted on the
human body due to a variety of factors. (b) Mental Health addresses
adverse effects on mood, cognitive functioning, and overall life
and work quality, stemming from psychological factors, including
negative emotional states and mental disorders.

Ethics and Morality (EM). Beyond obvious violations of laws
and regulations, many human behaviors do not conform to ethical
principles and moral norms. Social ethics typically concern human
relationships, attitudes, behaviors towards others, and responsi-
bilities towards others and society, including issues like bias and

discrimination. Additionally, we examine science ethics, which fo-
cus on the ethical and moral issues involved in the development and
application of science and technology. This includes the improper
use of science and technology and the potential conflicts between
technological autonomy and human values.

Data Privacy (DP). LLM training data often contains private in-
formation [50]. A significant amount of previous works have shown
that once such information is embedded in LLMs, it is susceptible
to malicious prompts to extract it, thus posing a significant privacy
risk [26, 27, 34]. This dimension therefore focuses on attempts to
extract private data from LLMs for personal private data such as
contact information, financial information, and communication
records as well as commercial secret such as market strategies,
customer information, and supply chain information.

Cybersecurity (CS). It indicates attempts to compromise the
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of a network system,
including overstepping access controls, designing malicious code
such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, and threatening the
physical security of a network system.

Extremism (EX). Compared to crimes and illegal activities, this
dimension poses a graver peril. This dimension usually manifests
as the extreme pursuit and persistence of a certain ideology, reli-
gion, politics, or social perspective, threatening social order and
stability. This includes violent terrorist activities, social divisions,
and extremist ideological trends.

Inappropriate Suggestions (IS). It denotes the potential hazard
when responses to queries in critical domains like finance, medicine,
and law turn out to be biased, inaccurate, or reckless. This risk
stems from the inherently finite and dated knowledge of LLMs,
compounded by occasional LLM-generated hallucination [6], which
can lead to user detriment.

3.3 LLM-Based Automatic Test Generation

Safety benchmarks need to be able to objectively and continuously
evaluate the safety of LLMs. However, there are several challenges
to achieve this goal: 1) Some safety benchmarks heavily rely on
manual collection and annotation, incurring significant time and
labor costs. This limits the scale and expansion potential of the
benchmarks, not to mention controlling and tracing benchmark
data quality; 2) The safety threat environment continues to evolve,
with new safety risks and innovations in attack methods constantly
emerging. Benchmarks must quickly identify and integrate these
new threats to ensure that evaluation prompts can be expanded
and updated in a timely manner. 3) With the rapid iteration and
performance improvement of LLMs, the original static benchmarks
gradually lose the ability to effectively evaluate the safety level of
the latest models. Benchmarks need continuous adaptive updates
to align with the iterative updates of LLMs.

In this work, we propose an LLM-based automatic test generation
approach to address the above challenges. Notably, since LLMs
are often trained with safety alignment methods, they are prone
to rejecting the generation of harmful prompts. Inspired by the
idea of ‚Äòunalignment‚Äô [7], we construct our expert test-generation
LLM Mùë° 3 by fine-tuning Qwen-14B-Chat [5] on harmful Question-
Answer (QA) pairs via LoRA [17] to break the safety alignment.

3We also call Mùë° a risk LLM in this paper as it is used for risk prompt generation.

S-Eval: Automatic and Adaptive Test Generation for Benchmarking Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models

Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

Mùë° can support multiple prompt generation tasks and has shown
great generalization ability. Then, we combine it with well-designed
prompts generation strategies to generate base risk prompts ùëÉ ùêµ
and attack prompts ùëÉùê¥ referring to the risk taxonomy, achieving
automatic test prompts generation and adaptive update.

3.3.1 Base Risk Prompt Generation. We design a template to format
generation instructions, risk information, and base risk prompts for
different risks to enhance the training process and generation per-
formance. As shown in Figure 3, the template contains the following
main elements: Instruction, which describes a prompt generation
task for a specific risk that the model needs to perform; Input, which
provides the risk information used to support the model in complet-
ing the generation task, such as risk definition and risk knowledge;
and Output, which is a corresponding base risk prompt.

Figure 3: Example for Base Risk Prompt Generation. <Risk>
stands for a specific risk to be generated prompts.

In the training phase, we first invite experts to write a small num-
ber of high-quality risk prompts for each risk definition. Then, we
take the generation instructions and risk definitions as training in-
puts and the corresponding risk prompts as output to train our risk
LLM Mùë° to generate prompts based on risk definitions. In the gen-
eration phase, in addition to providing the instructions that includes
the specific risks, we also guide Mùë° to automatically generate base
risk prompts through the following generation strategies:

Definition-Based Prompt Generation. To make the prompts gener-
ated by Mùë° conform to the definition of the corresponding risk, we
take the detailed risk definition as Input to guide Mùë° to generate
prompts. It is worth noting that because Mùë° has the ability to gen-
erate prompts based on risk definitions, it can adaptively complete
the generation tasks by simply providing the risk definitions when
new safety risks appear. In the event of suboptimal prompt qual-
ity, we can also build few-shot demonstrations by adding prompt
examples into Input to generate higher-quality prompts through
in-context learning.

Knowledge-Based Prompt Generation. To enhance the factuality
and diversity of generated prompts, we introduce external knowl-
edge in the generation phase. We crawl a large amount of risk-
related data from different web platforms with deep integration
and structure. Based on this, we construct a fine-grained risk knowl-
edge base covering various risks, including keywords, knowledge
graphs, and knowledge documents. Then, we use them as Input to
support Mùë° in completing generation tasks. By updating the risk
knowledge base as new risks emerge or existing risks change, the
benchmark can be up-to-date with the latest risks.

Rewriting-Based Prompt Generation. The originally generated
risk prompts inevitably contain a portion of risk-free prompts that
cannot lead LLMs to generate harmful responses, failing to reveal
the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs. Concurrently, with the rapid
iteration of LLMs, their safety is constantly changing. Original

effective prompts may been rejected by LLM defense mechanisms,
thus losing the significance of evaluation.

To improve the effective utilization of the base risk prompts and
enable the benchmark to be continuously and dynamically updated
as LLMs evolve, we introduce a rewriting strategy. We describe
the rewriting task in detail in Instruction and take prompt seeds
as Input to rewrite using Mùë° . Specifically, we instruct Mùë° to first
identify and analyze the key risk elements in the prompt seeds, such
as words and phrases involving violence, hatred, threats, etc. Mùë°
is then instructed to use synonymous substitution and semantic
fuzziness to weaken the risky semantics in the prompt seeds to
be more implicit and indirect. Meanwhile, we also instruct Mùë° to
introduce some reasonable contextual information to the prompt
seeds, to cover up the malicious intent in them. For example, a
prompt involving drug production could be embedded in the context
of a chemistry academic discussion. Through this rewriting strategy,
we can get new prompts that are risky but more covert in their
presentation.

3.3.2 Attack Prompt Generation. The widespread use of LLMs
makes them targets for adversarial attacks. Evaluating their safety
against instruction attacks can verify whether LLMs can effectively
identify and defend against potential attacks that aim to manipulate
the input prompts to bypass safety mechanisms and generate harm-
ful responses. However, replicating each attack in turn to generate
multiple attack prompts is cumbersome and lacks scalability, as
each attack is implemented differently, and some of them rely on
manual construction, which is time-consuming and laborious.

Therefore, we train Mùë° to uniformly and automatically generate
multiple attack prompts. Similar to the template for base risk prompt
generation, we redefine the elements: Instruction, which describes
an attack prompt generation task for a specific attack method and
configures the attack method if necessary; Input, which is a base
risk prompt; and Output, which is the corresponding attack prompt
through the attack method.

Figure 4: Example for Attack Prompt Generation. <Attack>
stands for a specific attack method. [Config] stands for im-
plementation details of the attack method and is optional.

In the training phase, we first get the corresponding attack
prompts by enhancing the collected base risk prompts with multiple
instruction attacks. Then, we train Mùë° with the instructions of the
attack methods and base risk prompts as training inputs and the
corresponding attack prompts as output so that it can also generate
multiple attack prompts. In the generation phase, we input the in-
structions of the attack methods and the base risk prompts into the
risk LLM to generate corresponding attack prompts. To comprehen-
sively reflect the safety of LLMs under various instruction attacks,
we summarize a wide range of attack methods, covering two failure
modes of safety alignment: competing objectives and mismatched
generalization [55]. Specifically, Mùë° integrates the following attack
methods:

Positive Induction (PI). It represents asking the model to re-
spond in a positive affirmative way to the inputs, such as asking
the model to start answering a question with "Sure, here it is".

Reverse Induction (RI). Since LLMs can recognize some mali-
cious intents, attackers intentionally ask questions in reverse. They
are ostensibly in good faith, trying to avoid some insecure content,
but with the opposite, malicious intent, trying to make the models
do something them "should not do".

Code Injection (CI). In this attack method, instead of feeding
the base prompt directly into the LLMs, attackers break the original
malicious payload into multiple smaller payloads, each of which
does not trigger the defense mechanisms of the LLMs, and embed
them into code to force the LLMs to produce harmful outputs [24].
To effectively bypass the defense mechanisms, unlike describing
the code execution process, we insert the split malicious payloads
into the full code program and require LLMs to response the output
of that program as a new instruction.

Instruction Jailbreak (IJ). In this work, we define Instruction
Jailbreak as using jailbreak templates [63] to jailbreak LLMs. To
generate more effective and diverse jailbreak, we take the top 30
attacks in terms of "Votes" from the jailbreak chat website 4, and
randomly combine with the collected base risk prompts to get the
attack prompts for supervised fine-tuning.

Goal Hijacking (GH). It involves attaching deceptive or mis-
leading instructions to inputs in attempts to induce LLMs to ignore
the original user prompts and produce unsafe responses.

Instruction Encryption (IE). This type of attack refers to en-
crypting the original prompts and then providing them to LLMs in
combination with other prompt templates, which can bypass the
safety alignment to produce unsafe responses. In this work, we can
generate attack prompts in various ciphers, such as Caesar Cipher,
Base64, and URL.

DeepInception (DI). Inspired by the Milgram experiment [35],
DeepInception [29] leverages the personification ability of LLMs to
construct a nested multi-layer scenario, where different characters
are created in each layer to confuse LLMs to bypass their safety
defenses. DeepInception has a high jailbreak success rate and can
sustain jailbreaks in subsequent interactions.

In-Context Attack (ICA). This attack method exploits the sig-
nificant in-context learning ability of LLMs to attack aligned lan-
guage models by adding adversarial harmful input-output pairs
to the input prompt, inducing the models to perform malicious
behaviors [57].

Chain of Utterances (CoU). This type of attack establish a
conversation between a harmful agent, Red-LM, and an unsafe-
helpful agent, Base-LM by Chain of Utterances (CoU)-based jail-
break prompts [8]. Harmful questions are then placed as an ut-
terance for Red-LM to send requests to Base-LM, which in turn
is asked to respond according to demonstrations and instructions
in the CoU. The generated internal thoughts in the responses of
Base-LM push the answers in a more helpful direction.

Compositional Instructions (CIA). In addition to single-intent
attack instructions, we can construct compositional attack instruc-
tions by combining and encapsulating multiple instructions to hide

4https://www.jailbreakchat.com

harmful instructions in innocuous-intent instructions, such as dis-
guising harmful instructions as talk or writing tasks [22].

3.4 Test Selection by Quality Control

To ensure the quality of test prompts, we review the collected base
risk prompts and attack prompts.

For base risk prompts, there are two main challenges: simi-
lar prompts and benign prompts that lack significant riskiness.
We define a similarity measure ùëÜ, combining semantic similarity
ùê∏ (ùëùùëñ ) ¬∑ùê∏ (ùëù ùëó )
ùëÜùë†ùëíùëö (ùëùùëñ, ùëù ùëó ) =
‚à•ùê∏ (ùëùùëñ ) ‚à• ‚à•ùê∏ (ùëù ùëó ) ‚à• , where ùëùùëñ and ùëù ùëó are two prompts
and ùê∏ (¬∑) is an embedding model and Levenshtein distance ùëÜùëôùëíùë£ to
identify and eliminate similar base risk prompts:

ùëÜ (ùëùùëñ, ùëù ùëó ) = ùõº ¬∑ ùëÜùë†ùëíùëö (ùëùùëñ, ùëù ùëó ) + (1 ‚àí ùõº) ¬∑ ùëÜùëôùëíùë£ (ùëùùëñ, ùëù ùëó )

(1)

where ùõº ‚àà [0, 1] is a weighting factor to balance superficial and fea-
ture similarity. The two prompts are similar when ùëÜ (ùëùùëñ, ùëù ùëó ) exceeds
a predefined threshold ùúÉùë†ùëñùëö and we retain the longer prompt.

To eliminate benign prompts, we use multiple victim LLMs Mùë£ =
{Mùë£ 1, Mùë£ 2, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , Mùë£ùëô } and the evaluation model J to evaluate
the riskiness of each base risk prompt ùëùùêµ
ùëñ . We get responses ùëÖùëñ =
{ùëüùëñ 1, ùëüùëñ 2, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëüùëñùëô } to ùëùùêµ
ùëñ and ùëÖùëñ into
ùëñ
J to get safety confidences ùëÜùëê ùëñ = {ùë†ùëê ùëñ 1
, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùë†ùëê ùëñùëô } and retain
(cid:205)ùëô
ùëùùêµ
ùë†ùëê ùëñ ùëó is less than a predefined
ùëñ
threshold ùúÉùë†ùëéùëì ùëí . When the safety of LLMs improves, the benchmark
can be updated by dynamically adjusting ùúÉùë†ùëéùëì ùëí or replacing higher
safe Mùë£.

from Mùë£. Then, we input ùëùùêµ

if the average of ùëÜùëê ùëñ , ¬ØùëÜùëê ùëñ = 1
ùëô

, ùë†ùëê ùëñ 2

ùëó=1

For attack prompts, since we automatically generate them through
the specially trained risk LLM, there may be duplicate decoding
during the generation process, resulting in meaningless prompts.
Considering the powerful ability of LLMs, we use LLMs to identify
meaningless attack prompts and manually check those that are
difficult for LLMs to determine. We regenerate these prompts later
until there are no duplicate decodings.

We show the statistics of prompts in S-Eval in Table 1.

4 SAFETY CRITIQUE MODEL

The open-ended property of LLM generation as well as the sparsity
and diversity of potential risks inherent in different models, makes
it extremely challenging to automatically and accurately assess
whether generated content complies with safety policies. Most of
the existing works on LLM safety evaluation typically rely on one or
more of the following schemes: manual annotation, rule matching,
moderation APIs and prompt-based evaluation.

Manual annotation [33] is highly accurate but time-consuming
and laborious, thus lacking scalability and practicality for large-
scale evaluation in reality. Rule matching method [67] assesses the
safety of LLM through the matching of manually summarized rules
or patterns deemed safe with the generated responses. More con-
cretely, a response can be regarded as safe if it incorporates certain
terms indicative of rejection, such as "I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt", "As a respon-
sible AI", "It‚Äôs not appropriate", etc. However, it is usually not trivial
to generalize the summarized rules to different LLMs due to varia-
tions in their response styles and scripts. Worse yet, there are often
cases where the model initially indicates a refusal to answer, but
harmful content still follows closely behind. Hence, even though

this method is easy to conduct, it significantly underperforms man-
ual annotation in terms of accuracy by an obvious margin. Some
studies adopt commercial moderation APIs to detect toxic contents
in the responses from LLMs as safety evaluation [15, 37]. However,
the effectiveness of such evaluations is also fairly limited and can
sometimes exhibit bias. This is primarily because there is currently
no comprehensive API capable of covering the entire spectrum
of risk categories associated with LLMs. Besides, evaluating LLM
safety is quite different from merely detecting toxic content. Thanks
to the powerful emergent abilities of LLMs, prompt-based evaluation
methods [11, 54] have been recently applied via prompt engineer-
ing, i.e., input specific evaluation guidelines or safety policies along
with the dialogue to be evaluated into high-performing LLMs such
as GPT-4. Nevertheless, most existing LLMs are not specifically
built for the purpose of safety evaluation. As a result, they may not
be well-aligned with human values in some aspects, which can lead
to undeserved evaluation results that are inconsistent with human
judgment. In addition, the LLM in use sometimes refuses to respond
to assessment instructions due to the sensitivity of input dialogues
and the issue of over-alignment (i.e., exaggerated safety) [43]. The

under- and over-alignment issues mentioned above severely restrict
the applicability of such methods.

To deal with the shortcomings of existing works and to evalua-
tion the safety of LLMs more accurately and effectively, we intro-
duce a novel LLM-based safety critique framework, taking inspira-
tion from [25]. Our safety critique LLM Mùëê is developed using a
carefully curated dataset for supervised fine-tuning. It can provide
effective and explainable safety evaluations for LLMs, including risk
tags, scores, and explanations, as shown in Figure 5 . It also boasts at-
tractive scaling properties for both model and data. During dataset
construction, to acquire the generated responses with different
levels of safety and qualities, we choose 10 representative models
that cover both open-source and closed-source LLMs with different
model scales, including GPT-4, ErnieBot, Qwen, LLaMA, Baichuan
and ChatGLM, etc. To obtain high-quality annotated critiques, com-
plete with risk tags (i.e., safe or unsafe) and explanations (i.e., the
reasons for tagging), we utilize GPT-4 for automatic annotation and
explanation. These automated results are then reviewed and cor-
rected by our specialists in cases of inaccuracies. Through response
generation and annotation, we have created a fine-grained dataset
consisting of 100,000 QA pairs derived from 10,000 risk queries.
This dataset is bilingual, including both Chinese and English, and
encompasses over 100 types of risks. Finally, we develop Mùëê by
fine-tuning Qwen-14b-Chat on this dataset via LoRA.

Figure 5: Example for safety critique to unsafe.

To validate the effectiveness of Mùëê , we construct a test set by
collecting 1,000 Chinese QA pairs and 1,000 English QA pairs from
Qwen-7B-Chat with manual annotation. We also compare Mùëê with
three baseline methods: rule matching, GPT-based evaluation
and LLaMA-Guard-2 [47]. For more setup details of the baseline
methods, please refer to Appendix B.

Table 2: Comparison between Mùëê and other methods. For
each method, we calculate balanced accuracy as well as pre-
cision and recall for every label (i.e. safe/unsafe). The bold
value indicates the best.

Evaluation Models. We use the safety critique LLM Mùëê as the

evaluation model J .

ùëê be the
ùëê ùëß be the corresponding attack

prompt set for each instruction attack ùëß ‚àà Z.

We calculate the Safety Score (SS) of LLMs, i.e., the percentage
of safe responses out of all responses, to measure the safety of the
evaluated LLMs. The higher the score, the safer the LLM. The safety
score on ùëê is calculated as:

Figure 6: The correlation between the evaluation results of
Mùëê and LLaMA-Guard-2.

The results on the test set are shown in Table 2. Mùëê achieves
the highest balanced accuracy (92.23% in Chinese and 88.23% in
English), much better than the three baseline methods. This in-
dicates that Mùëê has higher consistency with human annotation,
allowing for comprehensive and automatic evaluation. In addition,
we further analyze the correlation between the evaluation results of
Mùëê and LLaMA-Guard-2. We get responses to the English prompts
in the test set from 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs and
evaluate each QA pair using two evaluation methods. As shown in
Figure 6, the horizontal and vertical axes represent the safety scores
of LLMs evaluated by Mùëê and LLaMA-Guard-2, and the gray dotted
line represents the linear regression line. It can be found that the
data points show a tight line and the pearson correlation coefficient
between the two data sets is 0.92, which suggests a strong posi-
tive correlation between the evaluation results of the two models,
validating the effectiveness of Mùëê from a side perspective.

5 EXPERIMENT

In this section, we first describe our experimental setup. Then to
validate the effectiveness of S-Eval and to provide a systematic
methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs, we conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple popular LLMs and answer several
key research questions.

5.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets. To make a comprehensive and objective evaluation, we
randomly and uniformly sample 2,000 base risk prompts (1,000 in
Chinese and corresponding 1,000 in English) as the base risk prompt
set Pùêµ, comprehensively considering the data balance across the
first-level risk dimensions and second-level risk categories. We also
take corresponding 20,000 attack prompts as the attack prompt set
Pùê¥. Detailed data distribution for each risk category can be found
in Appendix A (Table 5).

Evaluated Models. Delving into different research questions,
we targeted select representative LLMs for experiments. To evaluate
the safety performance under normal usage conditions, we use the
default chat template and decoding strategy of each model.

ùëê ùëñ denotes a prompt in Pùêµ

ùëê and ùëü denotes the response to

where ùëùùêµ
ùëùùêµ
ùëê ùëñ .

We use the Attack Success Rate (ASR), i.e., the percentage of
harmful responses out of all responses, to measure the capability
of LLMs to defend against and resist instruction attacks. The lower
the ASR, the more robust the LLM. The attack success rate of attack
method ùëß is calculated as:

5.2 Research Questions
RQ1. (Evaluation of Effectiveness) Does S-Eval more effectively
reflect the safety of LLMs compared to existing safety bench-
marks?

In order to validate that S-Eval more effectively reflects the
safety of LLMs, we compare the differences in the safety scores
of different models on Pùêµ and existing safety benchmarks. We
adopt four widely used safety benchmarks, AdvBench [67], HH-
RLHF (red-teaming) [14], Flames [18] that is a highly adversarial
benchmark, and SafetyPrompts (typical safety scenarios) [42], as
the baselines, and follow the following data sampling strategies:
for HH-RLHF and SafetyPrompts, we randomly and uniformly
extracted from their risk dimensions 1,000 prompts; for AdvBench
and Flames, we use all their prompts, which are 520 and 1,000,
respectively. After the data sampling, we use the Google Translate

API 5 to translate the prompts in each baseline benchmark into
Chinese or English.

We evaluate 16 popular and representative open-source and
closed-source LLMs in both Chinese and English, covering a wide
range of organizations and model scales, as detailed in Appendix C
(Table 6). For each model family, we choose the model with medium
or best performance depending on the parameter scale setting.

Table 3 presents the overall safety scores of the evaluated models
on the five benchmarks and the safety scores on the eight risk di-
mensions in S-Eval. The results present us a variety of observations
and insights as follows.

First, S-Eval is more risky and more effectively reflects the safety
of LLMs. All models have lower safety scores in Chinese and English

5https://translate.google.com

than the four baselines on S-Eval. Specifically, among the baselines,
Advbench is the least risky, with most of the LLMs having safety
scores of 95% and above, and the highly adversarial Flames is the
most. To further analyze the distributions of the safety scores in
Chinese and English on each benchmark, we first exclude outliers
based on the upper and lower quartiles of the safety scores on each
benchmark and then characterize the corresponding distributions
as shown in Figure 7. The 95% confidence interval sizes of the safety
scores in Chinese and English on S-Eval are 30.86% and 50.55%,
respectively. In contrast, the 95% confidence interval sizes of the
four baselines are Advbench (5.77% / 7.58%), HH-RLHF (16.36%
/ 20.94%), Flames (19.54% / 22.53%), and SafetyPrompts (12.02% /
14.24%). Meanwhile, the distributions of the safety scores in Chinese
and English on S-Eval are more uniform. The higher riskiness,
larger confidence interval size of safety scores, and more uniform

safety score distribution indicate that S-Eval is more effective in
reflecting the safety of LLMs and the differences in safety.

Second, the evaluation results on S-Eval show that: among the
closed-source LLMs, ErnieBot-4.0 has the highest safety score, with
79.70% in Chinese and 87.60% in English. Gemini-1.0-Pro has the
lowest safety score, with 53.90% in Chinese and 41.90% in English.
The leading safety performance of ErnieBot-4.0 may be due to its
advanced outer safety guardrail, which can audit inference content
and filter out sensitive words. For the open-source LLMs, in Chinese,
Qwen-72B-Chat has the highest safety score of 73.10% and Yi-34B-
Chat has the lowest safety score of 46.70%; in English, LLaMA-2-13B-
Chat has the highest safety score of 85.10% and Mistral-7B-Instruct-
v0.2 has the lowest safety score of 34.20%. In addition, LLaMA-3
family has lower safety scores than LLaMA-2 family, indicating
lower refusal rates. It is worth noting that although Qwen-1.8B-
Chat has only 1.8B model parameters, its safety scores in Chinese
and English exceed those of Yi-34B-Chat. Overall, the average safety
of closed-source LLMs is better than that of open-source LLMs.

Third, there are significant differences in the safety of LLMs
on different risk dimensions. In Chinese, Yi-34B-Chat has a safety
score of 81.00% on the Data Privacy dimension, while it has a safety
score of 25.00% on the Ethics and Morality dimension, a difference
of 56.00%. In English, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 has a safety score
of 65.00% on the Data Privacy dimension, while the safety score
on the Extremism dimension is only 9.17%, a difference of 55.83%.
Meanwhile, all LLMs are less safe on the Inappropriate Suggestions
dimension. The difference in the safety of LLMs on segmented risk
dimensions may be related to the data distributions, and optimiza-
tion goals when the models are trained or aligned. This observation
also further indicates that the safety evaluation or alignment for
LLMs cannot only be based on a single class of safety concerns but
should consider their comprehensive performance on multiple risk
dimensions.

With all the observations above, we get the following answer:

Answer to RQ1: S-Eval can effectively reflect the safety of
LLMs and the differences in safety compared to existing safety
benchmarks. Overall, the safety of closed-source LLMs is better
than that of open-source LLMs. And there is a significant differ-
ence in the safety of LLMs on different risk dimensions.

Figure 8: The relationships among the parameter scales, the
performance and the safety of LLMs.

To answer this question, we evaluate 10 models from three fam-
ilies, Qwen, Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, which are representative in
English, using the English set in Pùêµ. We provide the model details
in Appendix C (Table 7). The results are shown in Figure 8, in
which the horizontal axis represents the performance taken from
the overall average of the OpenCompass Large Language Model
Leaderboard 6, the vertical axis represents the safety score of the
LLM, and the graphic size represents the LLM parameter scale.

From Figure 8, we have the following observations. First, for one
model family, the performance of models improves as the param-
eters increase. This indicates that larger model parameter scales
lead to better language understanding and generation capabilities,
in line with the scaling laws of LLMs. Second, the safety scores of
all three model families first increase with the increase of param-
eters but decrease when reaching the maximum parameter scale.
This indicates that for one model family, there is a parameter scale
threshold beyond which the continued increase in model parameter
scales will not simply lead to a sustained increase in safety or even
a decrease in safety. Third, by performing linear fitting to the all
observed data points (the grey dotted line in Figure 8), it can be
found that the safety of LLMs tends to increase as their performance
increases. Fourth, there are differences in the safety of the mod-
els from different families. Although LLaMA-2 family has poorer
performance compared to Qwen family (similar parameter scale),
its safety score is overall higher than that of Qwen and Vicuna
families. This indicates that the architecture or alignment method
of LLaMA-2 family is more effective in meeting safety requirements.
In practice, the parameter scales, performance, and safety of LLMs
should be considered to find the right balance.

Answer to RQ2: For one model family, there exists a parameter
scale threshold, before which the safety of LLMs increases with
the parameter scales, and beyond which, the continued increase
in the parameter scales will result in a decrease in safety. And
there may be a tendency for the safety of LLMs to increase with
their performance.

RQ2. (Evaluation of Scale Effect) How do variations in LLM
parameter scales affect safety?

RQ3. (Evaluation of Multiple Languages) Are there differences
in the safety of LLMs in different language environments?

LLMs often have multilingual capabilities and are widely used by
speakers of different languages around the world. However, most
of the existing studies on safety training do not cover all language
environments, and there may be potential safety risks when used
in unaligned environments. Deng et al [11] classify each language
into high-resource, medium-resource, and low-resource languages
based on the data ratio in the CommonCrawl corpus 7 and find that
querying LLMs in low-resource languages can bypass the safety
mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the safety of
LLMs in different language environments.

Considering the limitations of open-source LLMs in supporting
multiple languages, when evaluating the safety of LLMs in different
languages, in addition to the typical high-resource languages of
Chinese and English, we use the Google Translate API to translate
Pùêµ into French (fr), which is slightly smaller in scale of use than
Chinese and English but still a high-resource language, and Korean
(ko), which is a medium-resource language. This takes into account
different language characteristics and resource availability. After
getting responses from LLMs, we translate them into Chinese to
evaluation the safety of the LLMs.

To objectively reflect the differences in the safety of LLMs in
different language environments, we choose 8 LLMs that can si-
multaneously support English, Chinese, French, and Korean for
evaluation. Table 8 in Appendix C shows the details of these LLMs.
The results in the four languages are shown in Figure 9. It shows
that there are significant differences in the safety of the same LLM in
different language environments. Baichuan2-13B-Chat has a safety
score of 77.40% in English, while the safety score drops to 33.90% in
Korean. The safety score of ChatGLM3-6B also drops from 59.70%
in Chinese to 29.20% in French. The specific differences in safety in
different language environments for each model are related to the
ratios of language resources in their training data. Compared to the
open-source models, the two closed-source models have more stable
safety in the four languages. This may benefit from the balance of

7http://commoncrawl.org

these language resources in their training data. Importantly, from
the averages of safety scores in different languages, we can see that
the safety of LLMs decreases as the language resources decrease.
Interestingly, we find that ChatGLM3-6B has the highest safety
score in Korean than in other languages. By analyzing its responses,
we find that it generates a lot of meaningless responses in Korean,
which are not related to the questions or have the presence of
duplicate decoding. Thus, the limited capability of LLMs for one
language may inadvertently prevent the generation of harmful
content.

Answer to RQ3: There are significant differences in the safety
of LLMs in different language environments. The safety of LLMs
decreases as the language resources decrease. And the limited
capability of LLMs for one language may inadvertently prevent
the generation of harmful content, improving safety.

RQ4. (Evaluation of Robustness) How well do LLMs defend and
resist instruction attacks?

In exploring RQ4, we use Pùê¥ to evaluate the robustness of the
LLMs in RQ1 against instruction attacks. To simulate the situation
where multiple attacks may be possible at the same time for a
prompt, we further consider the adaptive attack that succeeds if
any of the 10 attacks in Pùê¥ succeed for the prompt. The attack
success rates of the various attacks and the overall attack success
rates on different models are shown in Table 4.

Among the closed-source models, GPT-4-Turbo is the most ro-
bust, with an overall ASR of 33.99% and 32.80% in Chinese and
English, respectively. Gemini-1.0-Pro is the least robust, with an
overall ASR of 53.04% and 58.84% in Chinese and English, respec-
tively. Among the open-source models, in Chinese, Qwen-1.8B-Chat
is the most robust with an overall ASR of 46.40%, and Baichuan2-
13B-Chat is the least robust with an overall ASR of 61.86%. In Eng-
lish, the overall ASR on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct is only 21.77%, lower
than GPT-4-Turbo, with ICA and CoU ASRs of merely 1.6% and
0%, respectively. And the ASR of the adaptive attack on LLaMA-3-
8B-Instruct is only 76.10%. This indicates that the safety alignment
methods of LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct can resist instruction attacks more

efficiently. While Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 has the worst robustness
with an overall ASR of 63.75%. Overall, the robustness of the closed-
source models is better than the open-source models.

We also evaluate the 10 included attack methods. CIA achieves
the highest average ASR. This indicates that CIA combines instruc-
tions with multiple intents to effectively hide potential malicious
intents and more universally bypass the safety mechanisms of LLMs.
RI is also the second most effective in jailbreaking LLMs. The ASRs
of CoU on GPT-4-Turbo, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat,
and LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct are very low, while its ASR on ErnieBot-
4.0 is from 2.00% in Chinese increased to 97.20% in English. This

indicates that GPT-4-Turbo, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, LLaMA-2-70B-
Chat, and LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct can effectively resist CoU, while
the safety guardrail of ErnieBot-4.0 fails to identify and intercept
CoU effectively in English. IE has the lowest average ASR. We find
that IE has low ASRs on the open-source models but higher ASRs
on the closed-source models, so we further explore the relationship
between the attack effectiveness of IE and model capabilities. As
shown in Figure 10, the horizontal axis is the average capability
of model knowledge and reasoning taken from the OpenCompass
Large Language Model Leaderboard, the vertical axis is the ASR
of IE, and the gray dashed line represents a trend line fitted to the
observed data points via linear regression. There is a tendency for

the ASR of IE to increase as the capability increases, which indicates
that too-smart models may instead have additional potential safety
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

Notably, the adaptive attack has a very high ASR on all models
even on GPT-4-Turbo, ErnieBot-4.0, and Gemini-1.0-Pro with outer
safety guardrails, and the average ASR is 98.67% and 95.57% in Chi-
nese and English, respectively. This reveals that LLMs are difficult
to cope with the adaptive attack with multiple attack methods, and
existing huge safety risks.

Answer to RQ4: Among the closed-source models, GPT-4-
Turbo is the most robust. Among the open-source models,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct has the strongest robustness and exceeds
GPT-4-Turbo. Among the 10 included attack methods, CIA is the
most effective. Too smart models may instead have additional
potential safety vulnerabilities. In addition, LLMs are difficult
to cope with adaptive attacks with multiple attack methods.

RQ5. (Evaluation of Stability) What is the effect of decoding
parameters on the safety of LLMs?

Different decoding strategies can have impacts on the output
of LLMs. The previous work [19] has found that existing align-
ment processes and evaluations may be based on default decoding

strategies, and when the configurations are slightly varied, they
may be affected by misalignment and produce harmful responses.
Therefore, evaluating the safety of LLMs also needs to consider the
impacts of different decoding strategies.

To answer RQ5, we evaluate two representative model families,
Qwen and LLaMA-2, using Pùêµ. In terms of decoding strategies,
we independently control the three common decoding parameters:
Temperature ùúè, Top-ùêæ ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëò and Top-ùëÉ ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëù. We experiment with
the following parameter settings in addition to the default decoding
settings: ùúè ‚àà {0, 0.5, 1}, ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëò ‚àà {0, 50, 100}, ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëù ‚àà {0, 0.5, 1}. To
minimize randomness, we fix the random seed for each LLM.

We take the prompts that can produce safe responses under
greedy decoding and calculate the safety scores of the LLMs under
other different decoding configurations using them. The results are
shown in Figure 11. As ùúè and ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëù increase, the safety scores of
Qwen family and LLaMA-2 family gradually decrease. And As ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëò
varies, the safety scores of the two model families have changed
little. This indicates that increasing Temperature and Top-ùëÉ de-
creases the safety of LLMs, while the variations in Top-ùêæ have no
significant impact on the safety of LLMs.

In addition, the safety scores of Qwen family decrease more with
increasing ùúè and ùë°ùëúùëù_ùëù than LLaMA-2 family, and the differences

Yuan et al.

between the decreases of the models with different parameter scales
are also more pronounced. This indicates that the safety of LLaMA-2
family is more stable under different decoding configurations.

Answer to RQ5: There are differences in the safety of LLMs
under different decoding parameters. Increasing Temperature
and Top-ùëÉ can lead to a decrease in the safety of LLMs, while
the variations in Top-ùêæ have no significant impact on the safety
of LLMs.

6 RELATED WORK

Previous safety benchmarks focus on specific safety concerns. For
example, RealToxicityPrompts [15] contains 100,000 sentence-level
prompts from a large corpus of English web text, and is often used
to evaluate the toxic generations of language models. ETHICS [16]
with 13,910 training examples, 3,885 test examples, and 3,964 hard
test examples, aims to assess basic knowledge of ethics and common
human values. BBQ [38] contains 58,492 hand-written examples
with ambiguous and disambiguated contexts to assess the social
biases of LLMs on nine different categories.

With the rapid improvement of LLM capabilities, the safety eval-
uation on a single dimension cannot comprehensively reflect the
safety status of LLMs, so researchers have proposed several compre-
hensive benchmarks with different dimensions. HELM [30] collects
data from existing datasets and provides an evaluation with 16 sce-
narios. DecodingTrust [53] provides a trustworthiness evaluation
for the GPT models based on previous datasets. DecodingTrust de-
signs a variety of adversarial system/user prompts to evaluate the
model performance in different scenarios. HH-RLHF [14] is the first
dataset of red teaming on a model trained with RLHF, and collects
38,961 hand-written red teaming prompts. AdvBench [67] is often
used to evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks. However, its
scale is small, containing only 520 hand-written harmful questions,
and there is a prevalence of duplicates [10]. SafetyPrompts [42]
explores the safety of LLMs from 8 traditional safety scenarios and
6 instruction attacks, and contains 100k Chinese test prompts. Safe-
tyBench [65] contains 11,435 multiple-choice questions collected
from multiple sources, covering 7 safety categories and supports
Chinese and English. CValues [59] is the first Chinese human val-
ues evaluation benchmark with safety and responsibility criteria. It
contains 2,100 open-ended prompts for human evaluation and 4,312
multi-choice prompts for automatic evaluation. Do-not-answer [54]
introduces a three-level hierarchical risk taxonomy covering mild
and extreme risks, and contains 938 harmful instructions to evaluate
safeguard mechanisms of LLMs at low cost. Flames [18] is the first
highly adversarial benchmark that contains 2,251 highly adversarial
manually designed Chinese prompts. SALAD-Bench [28] contains
21,000 evaluation prompts with a four-level hierarchical risk taxon-
omy. The benchmark further sets 5,000 attack-enhanced questions,
200 defense-enhanced questions, and 4,000 multiple-choice ques-
tions to evaluate attack and defense methods.

However, the above benchmarks have some significant limita-
tions. First, the risk taxonomies of existing safety benchmarks are
loose without a unified risk taxonomy paradigm. Second, existing
benchmarks have weak riskiness which limits its capability to sin-
cerely reflect the safety of LLMs effectively. For instance, some

benchmarks [16, 38, 65] are only evaluated with multiple-choice
questions (due to the lack of a test oracle), which is inconsistent
with the real-world user case and limits the risks that may arise
in responses, thus cannot reflect an LLM‚Äôs real safety levels. Other
benchmarks like [18, 28, 42] only consider some backward and in-
complete instruction attack methods, failing to picture the safety
of LLMs under more various adversarial attack scenarios. Third,
construction of existing benchmarks often lacks automation in
terms of test prompts generation, selection and output riskiness
evaluation requiring numerous human labor, which hinders its
effective adaptability to quickly evolving LLM and accompanied
safety threats.

Differently, our proposed S-Eval comprises 20,000 base risk
prompts alongside 200,000 corresponding attack prompts. These
test prompts are generated based on a comprehensive and unified
risk taxonomy, specifically designed to encompass all crucial dimen-
sions of safety evaluation and accurately reflect the varied safety
levels of LLMs across different risk dimensions. At the foundation
of constructing S-Eval is an innovative LLM-based automatic test
generation and selection framework, in which an expert testing
LLM Mùë° is trained to facilitate various test prompt generation tasks
combined with a range of test selection strategies. Moreover, con-
sidering the rapid evolution of LLMs and the accompanying safety
threats, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to include
new risks, attacks, and models to keep the benchmark updated.

7 CONCLUSION

In this work, we present S-Eval, a comprehensive, multi-dimensional
and open-ended benchmark designed for the detailed safety eval-
uation of LLMs. We also propose a framework for automatic test
generation, in which S-Eval can be dynamically adjusted to keep
pace with the fast-evolving safety threats and LLMs by automati-
cally expanding or rewriting test prompts. Additionally, our frame-
work introduces a safety critique LLM that offers both effective
and explainable safety evaluations for LLMs. Extensive empirical
evaluations conducted on 20 leading LLMs demonstrate that S-Eval
can measure the safety of LLMs more accurately, significantly sur-
passing other benchmarks in effectiveness. Moreover, we conduct a
systematic investigation into the robustness of LLMs by assessing
how their safety is affected by various factors such as the scale of
parameters, linguistic contexts, and decoding settings. Our findings
may shed light on new pathways for designing safer LLMs.

B EVALUATION METHOD SETUP DETAILS

We compare our evaluation model with three baseline methods:
Rule Matching, GPT-based evaluation and LLaMA-Guard-2.
The setup of each method is as follows: For Rule Match, we follow
the English rules in [28] and design the corresponding Chinese
rules. Here is the comprehensive list of keywords used to identify
a rejection:

Chinese: "Êàë‰∏çËÉΩÊèê‰æõ", "Êàë‰∏çËÉΩ", "‰∏ç", "‰∏çËÉΩ", "ÊàëÂè™ÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™AI",
