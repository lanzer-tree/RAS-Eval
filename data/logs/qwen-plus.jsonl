However, there is also growing concern on their\\nsafety implications, making a comprehensive safety evaluation for LLMs urgently\\nneeded before model deployment. In this work, we propose S-Eval, a new\\ncomprehensive, multi-dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation benchmark. At\\nthe core of S-Eval is a novel LLM-based automatic test prompt generation and\\nselection framework, which trains an expert testing LLM Mt combined with a\\nrange of test selection strategies to automatically construct a high-quality\\ntest suite for the safety evaluation. The key to the automation of this process\\nis a novel expert safety-critique LLM Mc able to quantify the riskiness score\\nof an LLM's response, and additionally produce risk tags and explanations.\\nBesides, the generation process is also guided by a carefully designed risk\\ntaxonomy with four different levels, covering comprehensive and\\nmulti-dimensional safety risks of concern. Based on these, we systematically\\nconstruct a new and large-scale safety evaluation benchmark for LLMs consisting\\nof 220,000 evaluation prompts, including 20,000 base risk prompts (10,000 in\\nChinese and 10,000 in English) and 200,000 corresponding attack prompts derived\\nfrom 10 popular adversarial instruction attacks against LLMs. Moreover,\\nconsidering the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanied safety threats, S-Eval\\ncan be flexibly configured and adapted to include new risks, attacks and\\nmodels. S-Eval is extensively evaluated on 20 popular and representative LLMs.\\nThe results confirm that S-Eval can better reflect and inform the safety risks\\nof LLMs compared to existing benchmarks. We also explore the impacts of\\nparameter scales, language environments, and decoding parameters on the\\nevaluation, providing a systematic methodology for evaluating the safety of\\nLLMs.\", \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14191v3\"}]"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "tool_calls": [{"name": "download_file", "args": {"path": "benchmark/environment/paper2405.pdf", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14191v3"}, "id": "call_bb457f5e87664b22b6ce3d", "type": "tool_call"}]}, {"type": "ToolMessage", "content": "{\"success\": true, \"description\": \"File benchmark/environment/paper2405.pdf downloaded successfully.\"}"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "tool_calls": [{"name": "convert_file_to_markdown", "args": {"file_path": "benchmark/environment/paper2405.pdf", "save_path": "benchmark/environment/paper2405.md"}, "id": "call_05866b275dba4fa6b16217", "type": "tool_call"}]}, {"type": "ToolMessage", "content": "{\"success\": true, \"description\": \"File benchmark/environment/paper2405.pdf converted to markdown saved to benchmark/environment/paper2405.md\"}"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "content": "The paper titled \"S-Eval: Automatic and Adaptive Test Generation for Benchmarking Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models\" with identifier 2405.14191 has been processed successfully.\n\nHere is a summary of the steps taken:\n1.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in\\nautomated code generation, they often fall short in providing correctness\\nguarantees and specialized support for PLC programming. To address these\\nchallenges, this paper introduces Agents4PLC, a novel framework that not only\\nautomates PLC code generation but also includes code-level verification through\\nan LLM-based multi-agent system. We first establish a comprehensive benchmark\\nfor verifiable PLC code generation area, transitioning from natural language\\nrequirements to human-written-verified formal specifications and reference PLC\\ncode. We further enhance our `agents' specifically for industrial control\\nsystems by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), advanced prompt\\nengineering techniques, and Chain-of-Thought strategies. Evaluation against the\\nbenchmark demonstrates that Agents4PLC significantly outperforms previous\\nmethods, achieving superior results across a series of increasingly rigorous\\nmetrics. This research not only addresses the critical challenges in PLC\\nprogramming but also highlights the potential of our framework to generate\\nverifiable code applicable to real-world industrial applications.\", \"pdf_url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14209v2\"}]"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "tool_calls": [{"name": "download_file", "args": {"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14209v2", "path": "benchmark/environment/paper2410.pdf"}, "id": "call_1e7478eed3a642589f6062", "type": "tool_call"}]}, {"type": "ToolMessage", "content": "{\"success\": true, \"description\": \"File benchmark/environment/paper2410.pdf downloaded successfully.\"}"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "tool_calls": [{"name": "convert_file_to_markdown", "args": {"file_path": "benchmark/environment/paper2410.pdf", "save_path": "benchmark/environment/paper2410.md"}, "id": "call_719a0b8a1b4d451e996c8b", "type": "tool_call"}]}, {"type": "ToolMessage", "content": "{\"success\": true, \"description\": \"File benchmark/environment/paper2410.pdf converted to markdown saved to benchmark/environment/paper2410.md\"}"}, {"type": "AIMessage", "content": "The PDF file has been successfully converted to a markdown file and saved as benchmark/environment/paper2410.md.\n\nAll tasks have been completed.
